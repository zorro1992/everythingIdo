You need to run this command from Master node 

Give the core-node ID in the section InstanceGroupId and you will be able to resize it

aws emr modify-instance-groups --instance-groups InstanceGroupId=ig-31JXXXXXXBTO,InstanceCount=4

Using this idea we can do time-based auto-scaling on the EMR 

    1) If your using Airflow then DAG 1 cannot be used for scaling because the above command is going to return success result. 
    2) Hence on the machine, you need to have a cron / Or a separate DAG that can be used to trigger this resize.
    3) Resizing takes time so let's say you need the cluster to be ready by 9:00 AM in the morning it is always better to start resizing 1 hour before for approx. 30machines. More the machines more time it is going to take.
 Once the ETL completes in the last DAG you can trigger an ssh command to go to the master and reduce the number of nodes back to 3 or 4.
