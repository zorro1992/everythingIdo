The idea here is
I have 4 commands and 100 IP's
I want to run these 4 commands on all the IP's
I don't have access to Anisble or some other automation tools has such.

So come up with a script that takes in these 4 commands from a file and also get all Ip from a different file
And run the command.

This approch is important because we then make our script generic.
