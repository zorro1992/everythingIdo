# How I have used Airflow in my workplace 

We also have a bunch of tools to solve a lot of problem. But there are some small things that can be handled very well by shell scripting or python or any scripting 


## What we did ?

We introduced Airflow .



I have attached the same airflow code what I have used to run in my office.

This was a easier way for use handle the errors . 

Visibility on when things failed.

I am working more on adding slack bot and other features .
